# Gene Graph Editor

Graph editor written in Angular. \
Developed with useage & customisation ease in mind.\
Allows changing grapgh appearance, editing node & edges details.

Everyone is welcome to fork and customise my code - nodes & edges can carry additional information which can be easly added to already existing implementation. By default, there are two types of edges - each can carry other data type (add data ifterface to edge model as optional field) - but if one needs more it can be easly done by duplicating already existing methods.
